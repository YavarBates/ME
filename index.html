                                                                <p> I was born on the 14th of September 1998 to Richard Bates and Saba Manavi Bates in <strong>Morges</strong>, VD, Switzerland. My father is English/South African and my mother is Iranian/Swiss. I have one sister, Yara Bates, who is 18 months younger than me and also in BOSC 6, at EHL. I grew up speaking English and French. I really enjoyed my time in all the places I grew up, as they taught me different things about <strong>life</strong> at different times. I am still in contact with many of my friends in Sydney and in Austin, and it has been <strong>interesting</strong> to see how their lives are moving forward as they have finished university and are working already. </p>

                                                                <p>During my BOSC 4 internship, I worked at Tetrapak, here in Lausanne. My position was one that I found very interesting as I was in Business Transformation. The easiest way to describe my job was that I was part of a global team helping the company switch directions and plan for the future marketing and sales of products and services based on different global regions. My job showed me how valuable data and customer feedback can be to such a large organization. I helped create documents from <strong>raw data</strong>, showing potential valuable information, helped design <strong> product growth</strong> roadmaps and I worked directly with <strong>consultants</strong>, exposing me to indsutry experts and other fascinating insights. My six months were englighting and productive, and I would not have changed if for anything else. I hope my next job will have many of the same roles and deliverables with more responsibility as I liked working in this department.</p>

                                                                <p>Outside of school and work, I find myself to be quite a simple person. I enjoy spending time with friends. I am lucky to have a great group of friends here at EHL. Our group is large and we always find something fun to do. Sometimes it is barbequing, sometimes it's going out, playing sports or even going on trips together. Personally, I really like all these things in a group or individually. I enjoy <strong>cooking</strong> a lot at home. I find it creative and relaxing. I don't have a favourrite cuisine as I do love most foods. I also enjoy <strong>travelling</strong>. I find it interesting seeing well-known places and I appreciate culture and arts that are attached to those places. I don't believe I have a favourite place I've been. Sydney is very beautiful, so is Switzerland. I went to a family wedding in South Africa a long time ago and I really enjoyed that country. Finally, I am a <strong>Chelsea F.C.</strong> fan. I have supported the team since I was 10/11 years old. There have been lot's of up's and down's during that time, but I wouldn't trade it for any other team. My favourite player was <strong>Didier Drogba</strong>, he made me fall in love with the team and the game of football. </p>
